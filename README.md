1. Allow customizations of groups
2. Remove "New tab" tab when moving to new window
3. if a tab is closed and associated domain no longer in the current window, remove it from context menu items
4. when move tabs to new window, open the new window in full screen


## Bugs
1. when move group to new window, error in console says that cannot created duplicate item id (not affecting anything for now)
